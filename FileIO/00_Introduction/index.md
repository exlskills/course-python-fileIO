# File IO

File IO stands for **File Input Output**.  This implies reading and writing files.  This short course will cover how to read and write files using python, and we will be using **Google Colab Notebooks** to achieve this, and all of these lectures will be directly tied to a Notebook.  

Below are the instructions to getting started with **Google Colab Notebooks**

1. Follow [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AFPMUJp3OTXKYnyaC-DI_WLhITmtWQMC) link to the notebook
2. Click **File** under the name of the document(_File IO Notebook.ipynb_)
3. Select option 9 -- _Save Copy in Drive_
4. Now you should have the notebook saved in your drive and we can begin with File IO
